# Coi

A component-based language for high-performance web apps. 
**Fast. Minimal. Type-safe.**

Compiles to WASM, JS, and HTML with tiny binaries and efficient updates for DOM, Canvas, and beyond.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is a work in progress. I don't recommend using it in production yet, as the language features and syntax are still evolving and may change.

## Features

- **Type-Safe Components**: Compile-time error checking with strictly typed props and state.
- **Reactive State Management**: Use `mut` for automatic, incremental DOM updates without Virtual DOM overhead.
- **Reference Props**: Pass state by reference with `&` for seamless parent-child synchronization.
- **Minimal Runtime**: Tiny WASM binaries with high-performance updates for DOM, Canvas, and more.
- **Integrated Styling**: Write standard HTML and scoped CSS directly in components.
- **Component Composition**: Build complex UIs from reusable components with typed props.
- **Animation Support**: Built-in `tick` lifecycle method for smooth animations and updates.

## Example

```tsx
component StepButton {
    prop mut int& count;
    prop int amount;

    def update() : void {
        count += amount;
    }

    view {
        <button onclick={update}>
            "Add " {amount}
        </button>
    }
}

component App {
    mut int score = 0;

    style {
        .container {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            align-items: center;
            gap: 20px;
            padding: 40px;
            background: #f0f2f5;
            border-radius: 16px;
        }
        .score {
            font-size: 64px;
            font-weight: 800;
            color: #1a73e8;
        }
        .controls {
            display: flex;
            gap: 12px;
        }
    }

    view {
        <div class="container">
            <div class="score">{score}</div>
            <div class="controls">
                <StepButton amount=1 &count={score} />
                <StepButton amount=5 &count={score} />
                <StepButton amount=10 &count={score} />
            </div>
        </div>
    }
}

app {
    root = App;
}
```

## State & References

Coi provides a powerful system for managing state and component communication:

### Mutability (`mut`)
Variables declared with `mut` are reactive. When a `mut` variable is modified (e.g., `count++`), Coi automatically triggers an update for any DOM elements or child components that depend on that variable.

```tsx
mut int count = 0; // Reactive state
int fixed = 10;    // Constant state (cannot be modified)
```

### Reference Props (`&`)
You can pass state to child components by reference using the `&` operator. This allows the child component to modify the parent's state directly.

1. **Declaration**: In the child component, declare the prop with `&`. Use `mut` if the component modifies the value.
   ```tsx
   prop mut int& count;
   ```

2. **Passing**: In the parent component, pass the variable with `&`.
   ```tsx
   <StepButton &count={score} />
   ```

When the child modifies `count`, the parent's UI (the `score` display) will automatically update to reflect the change. Coi handles the synchronization by generating efficient `onChange` callbacks.

### Function Props (`def`)
You can pass functions as props to components. Since functions are passed by reference, you must use the `&` operator when passing them. Function props are useful for triggering logic in the parent or for retrieving data.

```tsx
component CustomButton {
    prop string label;
    prop def onclick : void;

    view {
        <button onclick={onclick}>{label}</button>
    }
}

component App {
    def handleClick() : void {
        // Handle click
    }

    view {
        <CustomButton label="Click Me" &onclick={handleClick} />
    }
}
```

## Styling

Coi features a powerful styling system that combines the simplicity of CSS with component-level isolation.

### Scoped Styling
By default, styles defined within a `style { ... }` block are **scoped** to that component. Coi achieves this by automatically injecting a `coi-scope` attribute into your HTML elements and rewriting your CSS selectors to target only elements within that scope.

```tsx
component Card {
    style {
        /* This only affects divs inside the Card component */
        div {
            padding: 20px;
            border: 1px solid #eee;
        }
    }
    view {
        <div>"I am a scoped card"</div>
    }
}
```

### Global Styling
If you need to define global styles (e.g., for resets or base typography), you can use the `style global` block.

```tsx
component App {
    /* Global styles (not scoped) */
    style global {
        body {
            margin: 0;
            font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
        }
    }

    /* Scoped styles (only affects this component) */
    style {
        .container {
            max-width: 1200px;
        }
    }
}
```

## Building

Coi requires [WebCC](https://github.com/io-eric/webcc) (another project of mine) to be installed. The build script will automatically initialize the WebCC submodule and build it if it's not found on your system.

To build the compiler and the toolchain:

```bash
./build.sh
```

The script will:
1. **Bootstrap WebCC** (if not installed): Automatically initializes the submodule and builds the `webcc` toolchain.
2. **Compile Coi**: Compiles the Coi compiler using `g++`.
3. **Install Coi**: Offers to create a symlink for `coi` in your `/usr/local/bin` for easy access.

## Usage

To compile a `.coi` file:

```bash
coi App.coi --out ./dist
```

## VS Code Extension

A VS Code extension for syntax highlighting is included in the `vscode-extension/` directory. To use it:

1. Copy the `vscode-extension/` folder to your VS Code extensions directory (usually `~/.vscode/extensions/`).
2. Or, open the `vscode-extension/` folder in VS Code and press `F5` to run a development instance with the extension enabled.
